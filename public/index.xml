      <description>Research and Professional Interests&#xD;I have a background in statistics and public health with a bachelor’s degree in Statistics from University of South Florida and a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Boston University. After earning my MPH, I worked in Boston as a Data Analyst.&#xA;My current research interests are in exploring the measurement of health exposures, specifically air pollution. Air pollution is a growing public health concern and has been linked to many chronic illnesses.</description>
